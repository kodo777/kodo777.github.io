                        <br>
                          My musical journey starts in around 2018, I had recently discovered a genre called "chillsynth". A usually more downtempo subgenre of synthwave. Around this time was also when I started creating music using FL Studio, a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). My earliest creations are still released under an old pseudonym of mine (though the quality is very hit and miss).
                          <br><br>After being apart of the chillsynth scene I would naturally stumble upon vaporwave and future funk, similar genres, but sample based rather than purely original. As an effort to create music in these genres, I of course had to find samples of my own.
                          <br><br>This lead to the discovery of 80s Japanese pop, which I soon grew very fond of. This music was much more heavily inspired by jazz than what I had previously been listening to, and was a large step closer to the genres of music I now listen to today.
                          <br><br>In 2019 I moved from using FL Studio to Ableton Live, which I still use to this day. In the midst of this change, I would encounter a certain YouTube video on my home page. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIK1Vn6Va3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casiopea - Domino Line</a> was the spark that started my love for the jazz fusion genre, a blend of primarily jazz, funk, and rock. The bass solo played in this version of Domino Line would also end up being the catalyst for the purchase of my first bass guitar, a Yamaha TRBX204, in April of 2020.
                          <br><br>Fast forward to today, and I'm still listening to Casiopea, as well as jazz-fusion alongside smooth jazz. A mix of Fusion and easy-listening music.
                          <br><br>My greatest inspirations for Sai'Dezimo are Casiopea, of course, Katsumi Horii Project, a highly produced celebration of the work of some of the highest calibre Japanese fusion session musicians, and The Rippingtons, specifically, their late 80s and early 90s output. My main bass guitar nowadays, and the one I use in Sai'Dezimo, is a Fender made in Japan JBR-1000.
